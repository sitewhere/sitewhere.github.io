# Supported Device Hardware Platforms
SiteWhere provides an accelerated path to integrating with many existing device platforms
by providing libraries that do most of the heavy lifting. For platforms that are not
specifically supported by their own libraries, it is often a matter of a few lines of
code to have the platform use SiteWhere REST services to interact with the framework.
The implementations below take integration to the next level, supporting interactions 
over MQTT and allowing round-trip command/response interactions using the command and
event facilities supported by SiteWhere.
