# Mule AnyPoint Integration
Mule is a world class enterprise service bus (ESB) that makes it easy to integrate various
technologies without having to write a lot of code. Mule has the concept of *flows* that pull in
data from inbound endpoints, perform processing and decision logic, and route the resulting
data to outbound endpoints. The AnyPoint platform includes out-of-the-box support 
for *cloud connectors* which allow flows to integrate with many of the more useful 
cloud technologies such as Salesforce.com, Amazon S3, DropBox, Twitter, 
Google Calendars, and GitHub. Again, for a full list, take a look at the 
[connectors reference](http://www.mulesoft.org/connectors).

## Install AnyPoint Studio
AnyPoint Studio is an Eclipse-based user interface that allows you to graphically create Mule flows and execute them
locally. This makes it easy to assemble complex business logic and integration tasks in a short period of time. SiteWhere
provides a plugin for AnyPoint Studio that allows your Mule flows to pull in SiteWhere data and integrate it with
all of the other technologies Mule connects to. The rest of this document will help you get AnyPoint Studio and the
SiteWhere plugin installed, then will explain how to use them.

### Download AnyPoint Studio
Our first task is to get AnyPoint Studio installed. Since Studio is based on Eclipse, this is a very easy process.
Basically we just download the archive and unpack it. First locate the latest version of AnyPoint Studio for your
platform at:

> [https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio)
	
Once the file is downloaded (and yes, it's a pretty large download), the next step is to unpack it and run the
executable file in the root directory. Choose a workspace directory (the default is usually fine) and the Mule
Studio welcome screen should come up as shown below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/welcome-screen.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Welcome Screen">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/welcome-screen.png"/>
</a>
   
In order to make sure that you have the very latest components, it's a good idea to check for platform 
updates that have been published since your Mule Studio installation was released. If you click on
**Help > Check for Updates** and then follow the wizard, the latest plugins will automatically be installed.

## Install SiteWhere Connector
Now that we have a base installation of AnyPoint Studio, we need to install the SiteWhere Connector plugin.
To install the SiteWhere components, click **Help > Install New Software...**, then click the **Add...** 
button near the top of the page and enter **SiteWhere Components** in the **Name** field and 
**http://updates.sitewhere.org/current** in the **Location** field. The screen should look like below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/add-repository.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Add SiteWhere Repository">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/add-repository.png"/>
</a>
   
Click **OK** to add the new software site. Mule Studio will download information from the site and a 
tree will appear for Mule Modules. Check the top checkbox to download the components. See the image below 
for an example of what you should see:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/sitewhere-plugin.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Choose SiteWhere Plugin">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/sitewhere-plugin.png"/>
</a>
   
Keep clicking **Next** until you reach the end of the wizard. You will need to agree to the license agreement (CPAL) 
and will need to ok a message about unsigned content. Click **Finish** to complete the wizard and allow Mule Studio 
to restart when it asks. When Mule Studio restarts click **Help > About Mule Studio...**, then click 
**Installation Details**. There should be an entry for **Mule SiteWhere Connector Mule Studio Extension** in the list.
If you see the entry, you are ready to start using SiteWhere with Mule!

## Install Community Edition Runtime
Currently, SiteWhere does not work with the Mule EE runtime due to a conflict with the versions of Hazelcast used.
It's not a problem though, since Studio allows you to download other Mule runtimes to execute against. Choose
**Help > Install New Software** and use the dropdown near the top to choose **Mule ESB Runtimes for Studio**. 
After the tree appears, choose an entry for the **Community Runtimes** section as shown below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/community-runtime.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Install Community Runtime">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/community-runtime.png"/>
</a>
   
As with the SiteWhere plugin, follow the wizard and allow Mule Studio to restart. You should now be ready to start
working with SiteWhere data in Mule!
   
## Create a Mule Project
Now that the SiteWhere plugin is installed, we can create a test project to demonstrate receiving events from a 
running SiteWhere instance. To create a new project click **File > New > Mule Project**. Type **SiteWhereTest**
as the project name and make sure to check the **CE** runtime, then leave the rest of fields with default values
and click **Finish** to create the project (if you still have the welcome page up, you may have to close it to see
the new project). The screen should look like the one below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/new-project.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="New Mule Studio Project">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/new-project.png"/>
</a>
   
### Add a SiteWhere Configuration
There is a global Mule flow element that controls SiteWhere configuration for a flow. In the flow editor (the large area
in the middle of the IDE), click on the **Global Elements** tab and click the **Create** button on the right side. In the
dialog, open the **Cloud Connectors** node and choose the **SiteWhere** entry, then click **OK**. You should now see
the SiteWhere settings dialog filled in with the default values. In this tutorial, we are going to assume you are 
running on a cloud instance of SiteWhere. If you are running on a local instance, you can leave the default values
and everything should work. If you have not already done so, [start a cloud instance](/cloud/amazon_ec2.html). 
To point to the cloud instance, update the **SiteWhere API URL** value to **http://sitewhere-aws/sitewhere/api/** and
the Hazelcast **Remote Address** to **sitewhere-aws:5701**. The values should look like below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/sitewhere-config.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="SiteWhere Configuration">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/sitewhere-config.png"/>
</a>
  
The values in the **REST** section determine how Mule Studio interacts with the SiteWhere REST services. The REST 
services are used when data is submitted to SiteWhere or when information is needed from SiteWhere on demand. The values
in the **Hazelcast** section determine how SiteWhere connects to the Hazelcast instance running on your remote server.
Hazelcast is used for subscription-based actions like the event processing logic we will be using later in the tutorial. 
  
### Create an Event Processing Flow
Now that we have the SiteWhere configuration out of the way, we just need to add the processing elements to our 
flow to get the data we are interested in from SiteWhere. In this example, we want to subscribe to any *location*
events being processed by SiteWhere. As devices report new location data, that data will be forwarded to Mule 
after it has been saved to the datastore by SiteWhere.

First, click on the **Message Flow** tab at the bottom of the editor to go back to the visual editor. On the palette at
the right of the editor, open the **Cloud Connectors** drawer, find SiteWhere in the list, and drag-and-drop it out on
to the canvas. A new inbound endpoint will be added. Clicking on the new node should show its details in the properties
panel at the bottom of the editor. Change the name of the node from **SiteWhere (Streaming)** to **Locations**, then
open the dropdown for **Config Reference** and choose **SiteWhere** (which is a reference to the configuration we created
in the last step). Finally, choose **Subscribe locations** from the **Operation** dropdown and save your changes.

Your flow should now look like the one below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/first-node.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Add Inbound Endpoint">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/first-node.png"/>
</a>
  
The next step is to show the information we are reading in so that we can tell the flow is working. By default, only
very basic information for the SiteWhere event is sent over the wire. It doesn't include all of the details about the
device the event belongs to. There is a node in the SiteWhere cloud connector that will get the extra information
from SiteWhere for us. From the palette on the right, drag the **SiteWhere** cloud connector on to the canvas, 
positioning inside the dotted outline for the flow and directly to the right of the existing endpoint. An icon hint
will appear at the right edge of the endpoint if you are in the right place. Now drop the new element and it should
appear as a new node connected to the right of the endpoint (if not, delete it and try again). Click on the new node
and look at the properties panel at the bottom of the editor. Change the **Display Name** to **Device Info** and
choose the existing configuration reference from the dropdown. Choose **Build context for event** as the operation.
Now your flow should look like below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/add-build-context.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Load Event Context">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/add-build-context.png"/>
</a>
  
The final step in the process is to print out the *context* that has been created. SiteWhere has the concept of a
context that holds device events, their device information, and current assignment all in one neat package called
a **SiteWhereContext**. We can print the context to the Mule Studio log by adding one more node to the flow.
From the palette on the right of the editor drag another SiteWhere node out to the right of the **Device Info** node.
If done correctly, there should now be three nodes connected in series. Click on the new node and look at the 
properties editor at the bottom. Edit the **Display Name** to be **Print Context** and choose **SiteWhere** as the
config reference. Finally, change the operation to **Log sitewhere context** and save the flow. It should now 
look like the one below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/log-context.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Log Event Context">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/log-context.png"/>
</a>
  
That's it for our first flow! Now we can run it and see some data flow through the system.
  
## Run Your Mule Flow
To run the flow you just created, look at the **Package Explorer** view on the left side of the editor. The 
**sitewheretest.mflow** file should already be highlighted. Right click on the mflow file to open the context 
menu and choose **Run As > Mule Application**. If all goes well, a console window should show up with the
log from the newly started Mule instance running our flow. Maximize the tab to take a better look at the 
console. You should see log messages to indicate the system has started and has connected to your remote
SiteWhere server (if not, make sure your cloud server is running and properly configured). The console window
will look like the one below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/running-console.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Mule Console Output">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/running-console.png"/>
</a>
  
### Test with Sample Data
Next, we can send some sample data through the system to have it show up in SiteWhere. Normally, the data would
come from a device connected to SiteWhere, but for the sake of simplicity for this tutorial, we will use emulated
data. Luckliy, the SiteWhere admin console has a built-in emulator that can send in test data for any registered
device. So the path of our test data will be:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/flow-overview.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Emulator with Connection">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/flow-overview.png"/>
</a>
  
As you can see, we are bouncing data from our local desktop, to the cloud, and back via a subscription in Mule.

To send a test message, first log in to the admin console application at URL:

> [http://sitewhere-aws/sitewhere/admin/](http://sitewhere-aws/sitewhere/admin/)
	
Click the **Login** button which will open the top-level **Sites** page. Click the *green arrow* at the right of the
**Construction Site** entry. This will open the detail page for our make-believe contruction site. It will look 
something like the page below (depending on which release is running in the cloud, the sample data may look different):

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/site-detail.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Site Detail Page">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/site-detail.png"/>
</a>
  
Now click the green arrow to the right of the first device assignment in the list, which will open the *View Assignment*
page. At the top of the page there is an **Emulate Assignment** button. Click the button to open the assignment 
emulator. By default, the emulator is not connected to SiteWhere. Clicking the **Connect** button above the map will
establish an MQTT connection from your browser to the MQTT broker running on our SiteWhere instance in the cloud. If
the connection has been established, the button will turn green and its text will show as **Connected** as shown below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/emulator-connected.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Emulator with Connection">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/emulator-connected.png"/>
</a>
  
Finally, we can add a new location to the list. Clicking **Refresh Locations** will center the map on the last known
location of the device (it should already be centered there). Click the zoom button on the map a few times to zoom
in on the point. Click on the point where you want to create the new location. A dialog will open with the new
location information:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/save-location.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Save New Location">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/save-location.png"/>
</a>
  
Click **Create** and a new location should show up on the map (there is a slight delay because the call is async
and the browser just waits a couple of seconds before refreshing the map). If you swap back from the browser to
your Mule Studio instance, you should notice new data has shown up in the console (and a lot of it). The data is
a dump of the SiteWhere context including all device information, the current assignment, asset information, and
the newly added location. It will look something like the screen below:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/console-after-add1.png" data-lightbox="architecture" title="Console After Location Added">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/integration/mule/console-after-add1.png"/>
</a>
  
## Next Steps
In this tutorial we have installed Mule Studio and the SiteWhere plugin. We created a new Mule project and a flow
that subscribes to location events that SiteWhere produces. We ran a live instance of the Mule server in Studio
and, from an emulator in the SiteWhere admin console, created location information. The information was sent
from your local machine via MQTT to SiteWhere which stored the location (you can look at the locations log to
verify that it was stored). The location event was then sent via Hazelcast to your Mule flow which subscribed to
location events. The flow then asked SiteWhere for more event information and printed the complete event context
out to the Mule log.

This is only a simple example of event processing. In the real world, we would be talking to real devices over
the SiteWhere provisioning engine. From a Mule perspective, the event processing side of things is no different
for real device data than it was for the emulator. In Mule, we could take the location data and do interesting things
with it. For instance, the SiteWhere connector contains a node that checks location data against *zones* that 
you have created in the admin console. Based on whether the location data is inside or outside of a zone, Mule
can take actions such as alerting or pretty much anything else you can imagine.
