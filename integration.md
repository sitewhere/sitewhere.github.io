# SiteWhere Integration
SiteWhere provides a lot of functionality out of the box, but one of its most powerful features
is ease of integration with other platforms. Rather than reinventing the wheel, SiteWhere 
leverages other proven systems to expand its abilities.

## Mule AnyPoint Platform
Mule AnyPoint is a world class ESB platform that makes it easy to integrate various
technologies without having to write a lot of code. Integrating SiteWhere with Mule
opens up a world of possibilities in working with your IoT data. Use the
[integration guide]({{ site.url }}/integration/mule.html) to start integrating
your SiteWhere data with Mule AnyPoint.

## OpenHAB
SiteWhere supports integration with the popular [openHAB](http://www.openhab.org/) open
home automation project. The SiteWhere openHAB plugin (available on the
[downloads](http://www.sitewhere.org/downloads) page) allows SiteWhere to store
and process openHAB data. It also allows openHAB devices to be controlled directly
from the SiteWhere REST services and administrative application. See the complete
[tutorial]({{ site.url }}/integration/openhab.html) for an end-to-end example.
