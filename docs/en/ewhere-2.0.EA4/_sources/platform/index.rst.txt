SiteWhere Platform Introduction
###############################
The SiteWhere 2.x platform introduces an entirely redesigned architecture based 
on a modern microservices approach. It has been designed from the ground up for reliable, 
high throughput, low latency processing and dynamic scalability using technologies 
such as Apache Kafka and Docker. The intent is to continue to support most of the
data model and APIs from the 1.x platform, but to do so in a more modular fashion
that embraces modern development and deployment workflows.
